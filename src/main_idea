1)  we map each node to species tree
2) then if we have multiple node mapped to the same node in the species tree than we take all the children below that node and perform 1 NNI move.(branch below it) .Always get 3 trees so  we pick the one which has 
    lower one
        a) goto step 1

stopping criteria: If there is just speciation event in step 1.
                   OR : for a given threshold t, we perform the NNI move < t
                   OR : if parent tree cost is the same as children cost
