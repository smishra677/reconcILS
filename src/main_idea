algorithm
1)  we map each node to species tree
2) then if we have multiple node mapped to the same node in the species tree than we take all the children below that node and perform 1 NNI move.(branch below it) .Always get 3 trees so  we pick the one which has 
    lower one
        a) goto step 1

stopping criteria: If there is just speciation event in step 1.
                   OR : for a given threshold t, we perform the NNI move < t
                   OR : if parent tree cost is the same as children cost




Driver
1) first take a newick format string for species and gene trees --> from  a file and convert it to Tree data structure (done-->May 27)
2) Then map the each external node based on the Taxa name (Done-->May 30)
3) Then run the above algorithm (Done-->June 02)
